# Glasses

## Environments

Run ```chmod +x setup_env.sh``` in the terminal in the ```/glasses/``` directory in the terminal. This makes the ```setup_env.sh``` bash script executable. 
Then run ```./setup_env.sh``` in the terminal in the same terminal. This should install all dependencies.<br>
To start the environment run ```source yolo-env/bin/activate``` in the directory that the environment folder is stored.
To remove the virtual environemnt run ```rm -r yolo-env``` in the directory that the environment folder is stored.
